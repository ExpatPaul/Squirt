New Feature
-----------
New database option: Delete - Once a file is sent or retrieved, delete the source copy
    - New column added to database table
    - TODO: Make it visible/maintainable from squirt.py
        - Build: DONE
        - Display: DONE
        - Copy: DONE
    - TODO: Start checking the value in ftp_put, ftp_get and smtp_send
        - smtp_send: DONE
        - ftp_put: DONE
        - ftp_get

Get and Put should support changing the name of the target file.

Provide support for clearing a field (set column = Null)

Other fixes
-----------
smtplayer.py
    - Mail body should be switchable between free text or a file

squirt.py
    - Tighten up the parameters so that illogical options can't be entered

ftplayer.py
    - needs to support explicit mode switching (binary or ascii)

dblayer.py
    - Start returning more useful error codes

funlayer.py
    - Apply some consistency to the return values of the various functions

ftplayer.py
    - Support some more actions
        - GetNew    Like Get but only retrieves new files

Portability
-----------
Provide some functionality to export and import scripts as text (XML) files.
    - squirt export [script]
    - squirt import [script]

Undocumented Features
---------------------
Get fails on MLIST. Need to work around this for servers that don't support it.
