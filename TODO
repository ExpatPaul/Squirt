squirt.py
    - Add a protocol parameter to ArgParse so build becomes build ftp, etc.
    - Ensure that this works for the current funlayer and ftplayer functions
    - Start adding additional protocol layers
    - May need to rethink the scripts database

ftplayer.py

    - Improve the Put functionality
        - Proper handling of sub-folders is needed. When encountered, the script should work through the sub-folder as well

ftplayer.py
    - Support some more actions
