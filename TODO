SMTP Support
------------
smtplayer.py
    - Function send_smtp is working
        - Then it needs to be tied into everything else.
            dblayer.py - Done. Not tested
            funlayer.py
            squirt.py

dblayer.py
    - Implement SMTP support

funlayer.py
    - Needs to access smtp.py


Other fixes
-----------
ftplayer.py
    - needs to support explicit mode switching (binary or ascii)

dblayer.py
    - Start returning more useful error codes

funlayer.py
    - Apply some consistency to the return values of the various functions
    - Update script should not allow change to Protocol

ftplayer.py
    - Support some more actions
        - GetNew    Like Get but only retrieves new files


New functionality
-----------------
New table: squirt_streams
    ID          integer
    stream_name text

New table: squirt_stream_detail
    ID          integer
    streamID    integer; foreign key: squirt_streams
    scriptID    integer; foreign key: squirt_scripts

Then figure out how to string scripts together into streams
