New Feature
-----------
New database option: Delete - Once a file is sent or retrieved, delete the source copy
    - New column added to database table
    - TODO: Make it visible/maintainable from squirt.py
        - Build: DONE
        - Display: DONE
        - Copy: DONE
    - TODO: Start checking the value in ftp_put, ftp_get and ftp_send
        - Exec

Testing and Refactoring
-----------------------
See if the FTPLAYER can be cleaned up a bit

Other fixes
-----------
squirt.py
    - There really should be a bit of validation to ensure that the options are meaningful for the actions
    - validation.py?

ftplayer.py
    - needs to support explicit mode switching (binary or ascii)

dblayer.py
    - Start returning more useful error codes

funlayer.py
    - Apply some consistency to the return values of the various functions

ftplayer.py
    - Support some more actions
        - GetNew    Like Get but only retrieves new files

Undocumented Features
---------------------
Get fails on MLIST. Need to work around this for servers that don't support it.

New functionality
-----------------
New table: squirt_streams
    ID          integer
    stream_name text

New table: squirt_stream_detail
    ID          integer
    streamID    integer; foreign key: squirt_streams
    scriptID    integer; foreign key: squirt_scripts

Then figure out how to string scripts together into streams
