The outstanding functions
-------------------------
Documentation
    - Fix the project page on expatpaul.eu. It's a bit of a mess at the moment.
    - Review and rewrite the README

squirt.py
    - Add a protocol parameter to ArgParse so build becomes build ftp, etc.
    - Ensure that this works for the current funlayer and ftplayer functions
    - Start adding additional protocol layers
    - May need to rethink the scripts database

ftplayer.py
    - Improve the Get functionality
        - Proper handling of sub-folders is needed. When encountered, the script should work through the sub-folder as well

    - Improve the Put functionality
        - Proper handling of sub-folders is needed. When encountered, the script should work through the sub-folder as well

ftplayer.py
    - Support some more actions
        - GetNew    Like Get but only retrieves new files
    
funlayer.py
    - Apply some consistency to the return values of the various functions


New functionality
-----------------
New table: squirt_streams
    ID          integer
    stream_name text

New table: squirt_stream_detail
    ID          integer
    streamID    integer; foreign key: squirt_streams
    scriptID    integer; foreign key: squirt_scripts

Then figure out how to string scripts together into streams
