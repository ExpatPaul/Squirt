Enhancement
-----------
Add a --Test flag to Squirt Exec so that I can see what is about to be put without exploding the remote server

Other fixes
-----------
ftplayer.py
    - needs to support explicit mode switching (binary or ascii)

dblayer.py
    - Start returning more useful error codes

funlayer.py
    - Apply some consistency to the return values of the various functions
    - Update script should not allow change to Protocol

ftplayer.py
    - Support some more actions
        - GetNew    Like Get but only retrieves new files

The Database
------------
Clean up and improve consistency

New functionality
-----------------
New table: squirt_streams
    ID          integer
    stream_name text

New table: squirt_stream_detail
    ID          integer
    streamID    integer; foreign key: squirt_streams
    scriptID    integer; foreign key: squirt_scripts

Then figure out how to string scripts together into streams
