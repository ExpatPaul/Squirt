New Layer
---------
smtplayer.py
    - Function send_smtp written and unit tested.
    - Needs to be able to send attachments. Otherwise it's pretty pointless.
    - Then it needs to be tied into everything else.

The outstanding functions
-------------------------
dblayer.py
    - Start returning more useful error codes
    - Implement SMTP support

funlayer.py
    - Apply some consistency to the return values of the various functions
    - Update script should not allow change to Protocol
    - Needs to access smtp.py

ftplayer.py
    - Support some more actions
        - GetNew    Like Get but only retrieves new files

New Layer
---------
sshlayer.py
    - Implement scp

New functionality
-----------------
New table: squirt_streams
    ID          integer
    stream_name text

New table: squirt_stream_detail
    ID          integer
    streamID    integer; foreign key: squirt_streams
    scriptID    integer; foreign key: squirt_scripts

Then figure out how to string scripts together into streams
