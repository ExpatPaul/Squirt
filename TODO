Bug
---
Squirt copy is returning a fail message even though the action is successful

Testing and Refactoring
-----------------------
Fully test the FTP Port Changes
See if the FTPLAYER can be cleaned up a bit

Other fixes
-----------
ftplayer.py
    - needs to support explicit mode switching (binary or ascii)

dblayer.py
    - Start returning more useful error codes

funlayer.py
    - Apply some consistency to the return values of the various functions

ftplayer.py
    - Support some more actions
        - GetNew    Like Get but only retrieves new files

The Database
------------
Clean up and improve consistency

New functionality
-----------------
New table: squirt_streams
    ID          integer
    stream_name text

New table: squirt_stream_detail
    ID          integer
    streamID    integer; foreign key: squirt_streams
    scriptID    integer; foreign key: squirt_scripts

Then figure out how to string scripts together into streams
