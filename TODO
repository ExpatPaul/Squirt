squirt.py

    - needs to support explicit mode switching (binary or ascii)

dblayer.py
    - Start returning more useful error codes

funlayer.py
    - Apply some consistency to the return values of the various functions

ftplayer.py
    - Support some more actions
        - GetNew    Like Get but only retrieves new files
    -Get and Put should support changing the name of the target file.

Portability
-----------
Provide some functionality to export and import scripts as text (XML) files.
